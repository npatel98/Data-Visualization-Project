With the conclusion of the 2025 NBA regular season and the start of the playoffs, it is an exciting time for basketball fans as we look forward to the intense playoff matchups.

## **Key Elements of Visualization Design**

The visualizations created for this report were designed with the following key elements in mind:

1. **Interactive and Clear Visuals:** I used interactive visualizations to allow stakeholders to explore the data at a granular level. Altair was used to create scatter plots, bar charts, and line graphs, ensuring that the visualizations were not only informative but also easy to interpret. For example, **scatter plots** were used to compare player statistics like points, assists, and rebounds, while **bar charts** provided insights into key metrics like field goal percentages and turnovers.

2. **Color-Coding by Team:** To enhance clarity and allow easy comparison between the two teams, **purple** was used for the **Lakers**, and **sky blue** was used for the **Timberwolves**. This color scheme ensures that each team's data is clearly distinguishable, making it easier for viewers to spot trends and differences.

3. **Focused on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The charts emphasized metrics that are essential to understanding player and team performance. These included **points per game**, **rebounds per game**, **assists per game**, and advanced statistics like **turnover percentage** and **effective field goal percentage**.

4. **Positional Analysis:** A key part of the analysis focused on player positions. Bar charts were used to show performance metrics for each position ('PG', 'SG', 'SF', 'PF', 'C') to illustrate where teams have advantages or weaknesses.
